# Blog
A personal medium to share stories, insights, and knowledge.

## Why start a blog?
For thousands of years, people have been communicating through storytelling and it has been a potent method to inspire, to receive comfort, to educate, and etc. The potent part is that it doesn't stop there. People change, sometimes in a bad way and sometimes, in a good way. I want to do the latter.
