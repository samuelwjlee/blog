# Wordful
Learn new words while having lots of fun!

## User Experience
Currently, word learning apps require users to create virtual cards that contain word and its definition. With Wordful, users will be able to just `cmd + v` the word in the clipboard.

## Minimal Viable Product
* Users can login/signup using OAuth
* Users can save words in clipboard
* Users can view saved words
* Users can delete saved words

### Tech Stack
* React with TypeScript
* Node.js
* NoSQL database (TBD)
* Docker
