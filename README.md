# Wordful
A platform to learn new words with ease.

## User Experience
We encounter unfamiliar words everyday and sometimes we look them up in the dictionary but the words seldom go to long-term memory because we do not use them often. The only way to learn a new word is by repetition but in order for this repetition to happen, users need to type that word as key, look it up in the dictionary, copy and paste that definition as value. There is a lot of friction in this process. With Wordful, users will just paste the word in the copyboard to the platform and it will do the rest.

## Minimal Viable Product
Platform must allow users to login/signup with OAuth and enable users to paste the word into the platform. Users should also be able to view or delete words.
